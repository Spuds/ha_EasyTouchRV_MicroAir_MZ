# Micro-Air EasyTouch Multi-Zone (MZ)
Home Assistant Integration for Multi-Zone Micro-Air EasyTouch RV Thermostats

This integration provides Home Assistant control for Micro-Air EasyTouch RV thermostats with enhanced Bluetooth stability, automatic capability discovery, and multi-zone support.  This means the Home Assistant UI will only show controls that your device supports.

As I only have a model 357 (Dometic CCC1) that is all I've been able to test.

Requires EasyTouch Firmware > v1.0.5.99

Originally forked from [micro-air-easytouch](https://github.com/k3vmcd/ha-micro-air-easytouch) by [k3vmcd](https://github.com/k3vmcd), this version has been modified in an effort to improve BLE stability, Optimistic/Responsive UI, Supported HVAC mode discovery, Supported Fan mode discovery, Provide Heat presets for multi-fuel setups (Heat-pump + Aqua-hot) and Improved zone discovery.

# Installation Via HACS
